NAME
    Data::Password::Common - Check a password against a list of common
    passwords

VERSION
    version 0.004

SYNOPSIS
      use Data::Password::Common 'found';

      if ( found( $password ) ) {
        die "'$password' is a common password"
      }

      # import with aliasing
      use Data::Password::Common found => { -as => "found_common" };

      # custom common password list
      use Data::Password::Common found => { list => "/usr/share/dict/words" };

DESCRIPTION
    This module installs a list of over 557,000 common passwords and
    provides a function to check a string against the list.

    The password list is taken from InfoSecDaily at
    <http://www.isdpodcast.com/resources/62k-common-passwords/>. (They claim
    their list is over 62K, but they must have misread their "wc" output.)

USAGE
    Functions are provided via Sub::Exporter. Nothing is exported by
    default.

  found
      found($password);

    Returns true if the password is in the common passwords list.

CUSTOMIZING
    You may choose an alternate password list to check by passing a "list"
    parameter during import:

      use Data::Password::Common found => { list => "/usr/share/dict/words" };

    The file must be sorted.
